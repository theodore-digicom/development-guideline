title: Next.js & Shadcn UI Starter
---

This starter template is a production-ready boilerplate for building modern web applications with Next.js and Shadcn UI. It's designed to be a solid foundation for any new project, with a focus on best practices, developer experience, and performance.

## Features

*   **Next.js 14:** The latest version of the most popular React framework, with the App Router, Server Actions, and more.
*   **Shadcn UI:** A collection of beautifully designed, accessible, and customizable components that you can copy and paste into your apps.
*   **Tailwind CSS:** A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom user interfaces.
*   **ESLint & Prettier:** A pre-configured setup for code linting and formatting, to ensure code quality and consistency.
*   **Dark Mode:** A user-friendly dark mode implementation, powered by `next-themes`.
*   **Content Collections:** A simple and efficient way to manage your MDX content.

## Getting Started

To get started with this template, you can clone the repository from GitHub and install the dependencies.

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/nextjs-shadcn-starter.git
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
cd nextjs-shadcn-starter
pnpm install
```

### 3. Run the Development Server

```bash
pnpm dev
```

This will start the development server on `http://localhost:3000`.

## Project Structure

The project structure is designed to be simple, scalable, and easy to navigate.

```
/
├── content/          # Your MDX content
├── public/           # Static assets
├── src/
│   ├── app/          # Your Next.js app
│   ├── components/   # Shared components
│   ├── lib/          # Utility functions
│   └── styles/       # Global styles
├── next.config.js    # Next.js configuration
└── ...
```

## Customization

### Theme

The theme can be customized by editing the CSS variables in `src/app/globals.css`. You can change the colors, fonts, and other design tokens to match your brand.

### Components

You can add new components to the `src/components` directory. We recommend using the `shadcn/ui` CLI to add new components, as it will automatically add the necessary files and dependencies.

```bash
npx shadcn-ui@latest add button
```

This will add a new `Button` component to your project. You can then import it into your pages and use it like any other React component.
