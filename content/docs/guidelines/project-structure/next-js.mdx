A consistent project structure and naming convention are crucial for maintaining a clean and scalable codebase. This guide outlines the best practices for organizing your Next.js project.

## Component and Hook Conventions

### Component Structure

- **Global Components:** Shared, reusable components that are used across multiple features are stored in the `/components` directory at the root of the project.

- **Module-Specific Components:** Components that are only used within a specific feature or module should be stored in a `components` sub-directory within that module's folder. For example: `app/user/components/`.

- **Large Modules:** If a module becomes too large, you can create sub-modules within it, each with its own `components` folder. For example, if the "user" module has a complex "settings" area, you could have: `app/user/settings/components/`.

**Example:**

```
/components
├── button.tsx
└── input.tsx

/app
└── user
    ├── components
    │   ├── user-profile.tsx
    │   └── user-avatar.tsx
    └── settings
        └── components
            └── notification-settings.tsx
```

### Component Naming and File Structure

- **Naming:** Component files should be named using **kebab-case** (e.g., `user-profile.tsx`).
- **Co-location:** To keep related files together, we create a directory for each component that has its own styles or tests.

**Example:**

```
/components
└── user-profile/
    ├── user-profile.tsx
    ├── user-profile.module.css
    └── user-profile.test.tsx
```

### Hook Structure

The same principles apply to hooks:

- **Global Hooks:** Shared, reusable hooks are stored in the `/hooks` directory at the root of the project.
- **Module-Specific Hooks:** Hooks that are only used within a specific feature are stored in a `hooks` sub-directory within that module's folder (e.g., `app/user/hooks/`).

### Hook Naming

- Hook files should be named using **camelCase** with a `use` prefix (e.g., `useUserData.ts`).

## Page and Routing Conventions

### Page and Layout Structure

- **`page.tsx`**: This file is required to make a route segment publicly accessible. It renders the UI for a specific route.
- **`layout.tsx`**: This is a shared UI for a segment and its children. Layouts are ideal for things like headers, footers, and sidebars that are consistent across a section of the app.

### Route Grouping for Layouts

Next.js route groups allow you to create different layouts for different sections of your application without affecting the URL structure. This is done by wrapping a folder's name in parentheses, e.g., `(marketing)`.

This is extremely useful for creating a structured layout system. For example, you can have a separate layout for your marketing pages and another for your application's dashboard.

**Example:**

```
/app
├── (marketing)/
│   ├── layout.tsx  // Marketing layout (e.g., with a marketing header/footer)
│   ├── page.tsx      // Renders at /
│   └── about/
│       └── page.tsx  // Renders at /about
└── (dashboard)/
    ├── layout.tsx  // Dashboard layout (e.g., with a sidebar and user menu)
    ├── dashboard/
    │   └── page.tsx  // Renders at /dashboard
    └── settings/
        └── page.tsx  // Renders at /settings
```

In this example, the `(marketing)` and `(dashboard)` folders are route groups. They don't affect the URL, but they allow you to have separate layouts for the marketing pages and the dashboard pages.

### Dynamic Pages

- **Naming:** Dynamic segments are created by wrapping a file or folder name in square brackets. We use **snake_case** for the parameter name inside the brackets (e.g., `[user_id].tsx`). This parameter is then passed to your page component.

- **Potential Collisions:** Be aware that dynamic routes can collide with static routes. For example, if you have `app/blog/[slug].tsx` and `app/blog/about.tsx`, the `about.tsx` route will be rendered for `/blog/about`. However, if you navigate to `/blog/anything-else`, the `[slug].tsx` route will be rendered.

### Advanced Routing

Next.js offers powerful advanced routing patterns:

- **Catch-all Routes `[...slug]`:** This will match any number of segments. For example, `app/shop/[...slug]/page.tsx` will match `/shop/a`, `/shop/a/b`, `/shop/a/b/c`, etc.

- **Optional Catch-all Routes `[[...slug]]`:** This is similar to catch-all routes, but it also matches the route without any segments. For example, `app/docs/[[...slug]]/page.tsx` will match `/docs`, `/docs/a`, `/docs/a/b`, etc. This is very useful for documentation sites.
