title: The Basics
---

Before we dive into the nitty-gritty, let's talk about the "why." Why do we have these guidelines in the first place?

Think of it like this: we're a team of chefs in a big, bustling kitchen. We all have our own unique skills and talents, but we're all working together to create a beautiful, delicious meal.

These guidelines are our shared cookbook. They're not here to stifle your creativity, but to make sure we're all using the same ingredients, the same techniques, and the same language. They're here to help us create something that is not just delicious, but also consistent, reliable, and a joy to work with.

## Our Core Ingredients

At the heart of our cookbook are a few core ingredients:

*   **Clarity:** We believe that clear is kind. We write code that is easy to read, easy to understand, and easy to change. We choose variable names that are descriptive, we write comments that are helpful, and we structure our code in a way that is logical and intuitive.

*   **Simplicity:** We believe that simple is beautiful. We avoid unnecessary complexity, we favor simple solutions over clever ones, and we're not afraid to refactor our code to make it simpler.

*   **Consistency:** We believe that consistency is key. We follow a consistent coding style, we use a consistent project structure, and we have a consistent way of making decisions. This consistency makes it easier for us to work together, to understand each other's code, and to move quickly and with confidence.

## A Foundation, Not a Cage

It's important to remember that these guidelines are a foundation, not a cage. They're here to support you, not to constrain you. There will always be exceptions to the rule, and there will always be new and better ways of doing things.

So, as you explore these guidelines, we encourage you to think of them as a starting point. A place to begin the conversation. A foundation upon which you can build, experiment, and innovate with purpose.
